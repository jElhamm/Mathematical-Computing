# Fourier Transform

   * *Here you can enjoy learning and exploring the world of Fourier transform and mathematics! :)*


   [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) is a mathematical technique used to analyze periodic functions and signals.
   It decomposes a function or a signal into its constituent frequencies and provides valuable insight into its frequency content.
   The purpose of this section is to show practical implementations of Fourier transform concepts and algorithms for better understanding.
