# Matrix Sorting

   This program allows you to sort the elements in a Matrix. 
   You can input a Matrix and the program will return the sorted Matrix.

## Usage

   1. Run the program.
   2. Enter the number of rows and columns for the matrix.
   3. Enter the elements of the matrix.
   4. The program will display the original matrix.
   5. The program will then sort the matrix and display the sorted matrix.

## Example

   * We will use the following Matrix as the input:
   
                                        A  =  [[ 90 , 60 , 30 ],
                                               [ 80 , 20 , 50 ],
                                               [ 40 , 70 , 10 ]]

   * After entering the elements,
   The sorting algorithm compares each element of the Matrix with every 
   other element and swaps them if the current element is smaller than the compared element.

   * *Finally*, the program will display the sorted Matrix:

                        Sorted Matrix = B  =  [[ 10 , 20 , 30 ],
                                               [ 40 , 50 , 60 ],
                                               [ 70 , 80 , 90 ]]

## Note

   You can enter different Matrices with different sizes and elements.
