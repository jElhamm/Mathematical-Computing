# Exponential Distribution Calculator and Graph Plotter

   This program allows you to calculate the [*Exponential Distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) of a dataset and display its graph. 
   The exponential distribution is a probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process, 
   where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.

## Introduction

   *Exponential Distribution* is a probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process, 
   where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is often used to model the time between 
   successive events, such as the time between arrivals of customers at a service center or the time between failures of a machine. 
   The Exponential Distribution is characterized by a single parameter, the rate parameter, which is the inverse of the mean of the distribution. 
   The Exponential Distribution has many applications in engineering, physics, economics, and other fields.

                          |      The Exponential Distribution formula in mathematics is written as follows:      |

                          |       -  λ is the rate parameter                                                     |
                          |       -  x is the random variable                                                    |
                          |       -  The rate parameter is calculated as the inverse of the mean of the data.    |

## Installation

   1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
   2. Make sure you have **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** installed. If not, you can install them using pip:

## Usage

   1. Run the program.
   2. Enter a list of numbers separated by commas when prompted.
   3. The program will calculate the mean of the data and display it.
   4. The program will then display the graph of the Exponential Distribution based on the data entered.
