# Multinomial Distribution Calculator and Graph Plotter


   This program allows you to calculate the statistics of a dataset and visualize the [*Uniform Distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution) by plotting its graph.

## Distribution

   * The *Uniform Distribution*, also known as the Rectangular Distribution, is a probability distribution in which every possible outcome within
    a given range is equally likely to occur. It is characterized by a constant probability density function (pdf) across the range.

   * In a Uniform Distribution, the probability density function is represented by a horizontal line. The height of the line remains constant 
   within the range, indicating the equal likelihood of any value occurring. The range is defined by two parameters: the minimum value (a) and 
   the maximum value (b).

## Installation

   1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
   2. Make sure you have **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** installed. If not, you can install them using pip:

                                              __________________________________________________
                                             |                                                  |
                                             |     ***      pip install numpy          ***      |
                                             |     ***      pip install matplotlib     ***      |
                                             |__________________________________________________|

## Usage

   1. Run the program.
   2. Enter a list of numbers separated by commas when prompted.
   3. The program will calculate the mean of the input data and display it.
   4. The program will generate a graph of the Uniform Distribution based on the input data.
