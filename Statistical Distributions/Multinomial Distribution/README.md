# Multinomial Distribution Calculator and Graph Plotter


   This program allows you to calculate the [*Multinomial  Distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution) and visualize its graph. 
   It uses two methods to evaluate the distribution based on user-defined coefficients. 

## Distribution

   * The *Multinomial Distribution* is a probability distribution that generalizes the concept of the Binomial Distribution to multiple categories or outcomes.
   It is used to model situations where there are more than two possible outcomes, each with its own probability of occurrence.

   * In the *Multinomial Distribution*, the probability of each outcome is represented by a set of probabilities, usually denoted as (p_1, p_2, ..., p_k), 
   where (k) is the number of categories.

   * The distribution function calculates the probability of observing a specific combination of outcomes, each with a given frequency, in a fixed number of trials.

   * The *Multinomial Distribution* is commonly used in various fields, including statistics, genetics, social sciences, and market research, to analyze data 
   with multiple possible outcomes, such as survey responses, genetics, or customer preferences.

   * The distribution can be visualized using a graph, where the x-axis represents the categories and the y-axis represents the probability or frequency of 
   each category.

   * In summary, the *Multinomial Distribution* is a probability distribution that models situations with multiple categories or outcomes, providing a way to 
   calculate the probabilities of different combinations of outcomes and visualize the distribution using a graph.

## Installation

   1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
   2. Make sure you have **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** installed. If not, you can install them using pip:

                                                 __________________________________________________
                                                |                                                  |
                                                |     ***      pip install numpy          ***      |
                                                |     ***      pip install matplotlib     ***      |
                                                |__________________________________________________|

## Usage

   1. Run the program.
   2. Enter the coefficients of the polynomial when prompted. Separate the coefficients by spaces.
   3. The program will calculate and display the Multinomial Distribution graph.
   5. The graph will be displayed in a separate window.
