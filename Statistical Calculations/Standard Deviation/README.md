# Standard Deviation

   This section contains two Python programs designed to calculate the [*Standard deviation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)
   of a set of data points. Each program uses a different library for calculations.

   * (Program 1)[standardDeviation%20(math_Library).py]  --->   [math Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
   * (Program 2)[standardDeviation%20(statistics_library).py]  --->   [statistics Library](https://realpython.com/python-statistics/)

## Description

   *Standard Deviation* is a measure of how spread out the values of a dataset are.
   It calculates the average distance between each data point and the mean of the dataset. 
   A higher Standard Deviation indicates a wider range of values, while a lower Standard Deviation 
   indicates a more concentrated dataset. It is used to understand the variability and dispersion of data.

                |    The formula for (Standard Deviation) is as follows:    |           
                |                  σ = √(Σ(xi - μ)² / N)                    |     
                |          --->    σ = standard deviation                   |     
                |          --->    Σ = sum of                               |    
                |          --->    xi = individual data point               |     
                |          --->    μ = mean (average)                       |    
                |          --->    N = number of data points                |     
                |___________________________________________________________|


## Usage

   1. Run the program.
   2. You will be prompted to enter a list of data, separated by spaces.
   3. Input the desired data points.
   4. The program will calculate and display the standard deviation.

  * *Both programs are included in this repository, with separate files for each.*
